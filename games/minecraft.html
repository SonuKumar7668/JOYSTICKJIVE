            <h1>ABOUT THIS GAME</h1>
            <p>Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and originally released in 2009. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has become the best-selling video game in history, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023. It has been ported to several platforms.</p>
            <h3>Dimensions</h3>
            <p>Minecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the Overworld (the main world): the Nether and the End.</p>
            <h3>The Nether</h3>
            <p>The Nether is a hell-like underworld dimension accessed via either a player-built obsidian portal or one of the Ruined Portals randomly generated throughout the world. It contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the Overworld, due to every block traveled in the Nether being equivalent to 8 blocks traveled in the Overworld.[35] Water cannot exist in the Nether, as it vaporizes instantly.[citation needed] The Nether is mainly populated by pigman-like mobs called piglins and their zombified counterparts, plus floating balloon-like mobs called ghasts.[36] The piglins are considered particularly noteworthy because of their bartering system, where the player can give them gold ingots and receive items in return.[37] The player can also build an optional boss mob called The Wither out of materials found in the Nether.</p>
            <h3>The End</h3>
            <p>The End is reached by underground portals in the Overworld. It consists of islands floating above a dark, bottomless void. A boss dragon called the Ender Dragon guards the largest, central island.[39] Killing the dragon opens access to an exit portal, which, when entered, cues the game's ending credits and the End Poem, a roughly 1,500-word work written by Irish novelist Julian Gough,[40] which takes about nine minutes to scroll past[41] and is the game's only narrative text[42] and only text of significant length directed at the player. 10–12  At the conclusion of the credits, the player is teleported back to their respawn point and may continue the game indefinitely.</p>
            <h1>Game modes</h1>
            <h3>Survival mode</h3>
            <p>In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.[26] Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night.[26] The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events.[45] Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game (except in peaceful difficulty).[45][46] If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.</p>
            <h3>Creative mode</h3>
            <p>In creative mode, players have access to nearly all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu and can place or remove them instantly.[53] Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger.[54][55] The game mode helps players focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance.</p>
            <h3>Other game modes</h3>
            <p>Minecraft includes other game modes such as spectator mode, which allows players to fly through blocks. Hardcore mode, available only in Java Edition, is a survival mode variant in which, upon death, the player may only view the world in spectator mode or return to the game's menu.[56] Adventure mode is a survival mode variant with possible restrictions added by a creator of a map.</p>
